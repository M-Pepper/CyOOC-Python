*Deliverable*

Modify deliverable.py and implement `guess_number` so that it repeatedly asks the user for a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. If the user correctly guesses the value of the given argument `n`, print 'WIN' and return. Otherwise indicate whether the guess was too high or too low. Test the deliverable manually or run `python3 check.py` to run the supplied unit tests.
