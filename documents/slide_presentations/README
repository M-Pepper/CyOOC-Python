Build slide shows as asciidoc then render in html using reveal.js.
The asciidoc/reveal.js process is well documented online and there
is a summary below.  If you get stuck contact the dev team.

[PROCESS SUMMARY]

1. Create project directory

   $ mkdir my-awesome-presentation
   $ cd my-awesome-presentation

2. Create a file named Gemfile with the following content:

   source 'https://rubygems.org'

   gem 'asciidoctor-revealjs' # latest released version
   gem 'json'
   gem 'coderay'

3. Install the gems into the project

   $ bundle config --local github.https true
   $ bundle --path=.bundle/gems --binstubs=.bundle/.bin

   Optional: Copy or clone reveal.js presentation framework. Allows you to modify themes or view slides offline.
   You'll notice I always do this.
      $ git clone -b 3.3.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git

Rendering the AsciiDoc into slides

1. Create content in a file (*.adoc, *.ad, etc.). See examples in Syntax Examples section to get started or look at files in test/.

2. Generate HTML presentation from the AsciiDoc source

   $ bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs CONTENT_FILE.adoc

   If you are using GitHub Pages, plan ahead by keeping your source files on master branch and all output files on the gh-pages branch.

3. If you're comfortable using make, then simply modify my Makefile. Add a new target to the Makefile to create your slides by copying one of my targets and making the appropriate changes.
