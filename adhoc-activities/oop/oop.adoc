Design a program that models a deck of standard playing cards.

Design a minimum of 2 classes: Card and Deck.

An instance of Deck should initialize 52 instances of Card and should have the following methods:

.Deck methods
[source,python]
----
def shuffle(self):
    '''Randomly shuffles the deck
    Args:
        None
    Returns:
        None
    '''
    pass

def deal(self,cards=1):
    '''Deals a number of cards
    Args:
        cards (int): the number of cards to remove from the deck
    Returns:
        list: list of cards dealt
    '''
    pass
----

Each instance of Card should be initialized with a suit and face value and should customize the way it represents itself as a string.
